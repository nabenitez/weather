# TODOs

- Global state management
- Services module
- Improve input parsers
- Make BFF if api_key is private (I assumed is not!)

# Run the project

You need to add the API KEY value, with the following name:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=
```

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Test the project

- You need to have npm modules installed.

```bash
npm run test:cy
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
